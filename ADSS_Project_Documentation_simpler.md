# Abia Farm Helper - Simple Guide

## 📌 What is this?
This is a computer tool made specifically for farmers in Abia State (Aba, Umuahia, Bende). Instead of guessing about the weather, this system watches the rain and sun for you. It helps you decide the best time to plant, spray medicine, and harvest your crops.

## 🎯 How it Helps You
1.  **Watches the Weather**: It automatically checks the rain, wind, and heat every day for you.
2.  **Warns You**: It sends a warning if it is getting too dry (drought) or too wet (flood).
3.  **Best Planting Time**: It looks at rain from past years to suggest the best week to put seeds in the ground.
4.  **Crop Health**: It tracks how much heat your crops are getting to see if they are growing on time.

## 🛠️ The Tools Inside (Tabs)
The system has **7 sections** that act like different tools in your toolbox:

### 📊 1. Current Weather (What is happening NOW)
*   **Purpose**: A quick look outside.
*   **What you see**: clearly shows if it is Hot or Cold, how fast the Wind is blowing, and if it rained today.
*   **Trends**: Simple lines showing if today is hotter or cooler than yesterday.

### 🔮 2. Weather Plan (What is coming SOON)
*   **Purpose**: Helps you plan for tomorrow and the next day.
*   **48-Hour Look**: Shows hour-by-hour if rain is coming. **Use this to decide when to spray fertilizer** (don't spray if rain is coming!).
*   **5-Day Look**: A simple summary for the whole week.

### 📜 3. Rain History (Compare with OLD years)
*   **Purpose**: See if this year is different from normal.
*   **Yearly Rain**: Bars showing if this year has more or less rain than last year (since 2020).
*   **Start of Planting**: Helps identify the "real" start of the rainy season so you don't plant too early and waste seeds.

### 💧 4. Danger Alerts (Risks)
*   **Purpose**: Safety warnings for your farm.
*   **Dry Warning (Drought) 🚨**: Warns you if there has been very little rain (< 5mm) in the last week. You might need to water.
*   **Flood Warning (Waterlogging) ⚠️**: Warns you if there has been too much rain (> 150mm) in the last week. Check your drains so roots don't rot!

### 🌱 5. Crop Growth Tracker
*   **Purpose**: Knowing when to harvest.
*   **How it works**: Plants need heat to grow, not just time. We count "Heat Units".
*   **Why use it**: It tells you if your Maize or Cassava is ready to harvest, or if it needs more time because the weather was cool.

### 🗓️ 6. Planting Helper
*   **Purpose**: Making big decisions.
*   **Season View**: Compares this year's weather to the "normal" weather from past years.
*   **Is it good to plant?**: A simple score that tells you if the ground and weather are right for your specific crop.

### 📁 7. Records
*   **Purpose**: Keeps a diary of all weather data.
*   **Download**: You can save all the information to your computer if you need it later.

## 📚 Simple Explanations of Terms

### 1. "Heat Units" (GDD)
*   **What is it?**: Think of plants like solar batteries. They need to collect a certain amount of "heat energy" to finish growing.
*   **Why care?**: Counting days on a calendar is not accurate. Counting "Heat Units" is accurate. It helps you harvest at the perfect time.

### 2. Air Wetness (Humidity)
*   **High Wetness**: If the air is very wet (>80%), fungus and diseases can attack your plants easily. Watch out for spots on leaves!
*   **Low Wetness**: If the air is very dry (<40%), plants lose water fast and get thirsty.

### 3. "Rolling Rainfall"
*   **What is it?**: The total amount of rain that fell in the last 7 days combined.
*   **Why care?**: It tells you the true condition of your soil. One heavy rain is okay, but heavy rain for 7 days is a flood risk.

### 4. Wind Speed
*   **Spraying**: Do **NOT** spray medicine if the wind is blowing hard (> 5 m/s). It will blow the medicine away and waste your money.
*   **Storms**: Very strong wind (> 10 m/s) can break tall corn stalks. Be prepared.
